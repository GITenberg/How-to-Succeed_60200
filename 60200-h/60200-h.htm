<p>Those acts which go to form a person’s influence are little things,
but they are potential for good or bad in the lives of others. Though
they are as fleeting as the breath which gave them, their influence is
as enduring as they reach. But may we strive to scatter loving,
cheering, encouraging words, to soothe the weary, and awaken the
nobler feelings of those with whom we daily come in contact.</p>

<p>The cause of great joys, like those of sorrow, are few and far between,
but every day brings us much good if we will but gather it. All
successful men are remarkable, not only for general vigor, but for
their attention. It is often that in view of these facts men will often
neglect. He who waits to do a great deal of good at once will never
do anything. In the complicated and marvelous machinery of circumstances
it is absolutely impossible to decide what would have happened
to some event if the smallest deviation had taken place in the march
of those who preceded them. The little things in youth accumulate
into character in age and destiny in eternity. Little sins make up the
grand total of life. Each day is brightened or clouded. Great things
come but seldom, and are often unrecognized until passed. If a man
conceives the idea of becoming eminent in learning, and cannot toil
through the many drudgeries necessary to carry him on, his learning<!-- TN: original reads "leaning" -->
will soon be told. Or if he undertakes to become rich, but despises
the small and gradual advances by which wealth is acquired, his expectations
will be the sum of his riches. The successful business man
at home, surrounded by articles of luxury, is a spectacle calculated to
spur on the toiler.</p>

<p>But the merchant at his office has had to work, yes to toil over columns
of figures to post his ledger; and while you were carelessly
spending a dollar, he has ransacked his books to discover what has become
of a stray shilling. Words may seem to us but little things, but
they possess a power beyond calculation. They swiftly fly from us to
others, and we scarcely give them a passing thought.</p>

</h2>


<p>It is a mistake to suppose that men succeed through
success; they much oftener succeed through failure. There
were hours of despondency when Shakespeare<!-- TN original reads "Shakesphere" --> thought himself
no poet and Raphael<!-- TN: original reads "Raphel" --> no painter, when the greatest wits
doubted the excellence of their happiest efforts.</p>

<p>Many have to make up their need to encounter failure
again and again before they finally succeed, but if they
have pluck the failure will only serve to arouse their energies,
and stimulate them to renewed efforts.<!-- TN: period invisible --> No one can
tell how many of the world’s most brilliant geniuses have
succeed because of their first failures. Precept, study, advice
and example could never have taught them so well as failure
has done and<!-- TN: original reads "hnd" --> this latter is often of more importance than
the former.</p>

<p>We have read of our late B. T. Washington, we can
realize the fact that from boyhood even till his death, he
sought an opportunity, though the opportunity sometime
seemed to be very small. Dr. B. T. felt the need of an education
yes, he felt there was something he could do someday
for the betterment of his race, so he accepted the small
opportunities and after became a man of fame, integrity,
and honor, he did not have the opportunity that most of the
boys and girls have today, but because of his determination
he was able to live and die a man of fame and honor.</p>

<p>Young Ladies and Gentlemen; a great deal has
been done to help improve to the race, but do you know
there is still more to be done, and there is something that
we can do. There is more expected of us today than it was
expected of men years ago; so we must begin work more
earlier in life. Young Ladies and Gentlemen; let us put our
whole heart mind and brains to work to help improve
our race; though we may fail but from this failure
we can organize future success.</p>

<p>We may wish ourselves great but unless we do something
we shall forever be a wisher.</p>

<p>We must realize that our ways in this world is like a
wall under a row of trees, checked with light and shade,
and because we cannot all walk along<!-- TN: original reads "a long" --> in the sunshine, we
therefore, fix upon the darker passages and so lose<!--TN: original reads "loose" --> all
the comfort of the cheering ones. There is no royal road
to success,<!-- TN: comma inserted --> the road that leads to success lies through fields
of hard, earnest and patient labor, it calls on the young man
and woman put forth all energy, and bids him build well his
foundation, go to success since it will not come to you, and
<a name="png.006" id="png.006" href="#png.006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>remember even as steel is tempered by heat, and through
much hammering and changing original form, is at last
wrought into useful articles, so in the history of many men
do we find that they were attempered in the furnace<!-- TN: original reads "furnance" --> of
trials and afflictions.</p>

<p>Let us then strive against despondency, even when the
way before us is both dark and dreary it still is
worse than useless to give away to despondency. Energy
and proper afflictions may recover what you have lost;<!-- TN: semicolon inserted --> take
heart; pluck up courage; give not over to despondency;<!-- TN: semicolon inserted --> by
confronting the evils of life they will lose their force.</p>

<p>We are able to know today that intelligence<!-- TN: original reads "intelligency" --> has awakened
and spreaded out her hands, and from time immemorial<!-- TN: original reads "imemorial" -->
intellectual endowment have been crowned with bays of
honor, men have worshiped at the sign of intellect with
almost an eastern idolatry<!-- TN: original reads "idolitary" -->, the world at large has crowned
education with its richest honors,<!-- TN: comma inserted --> its pathway has<!-- TN: original reads "has has" --> been
strewn<!-- TN: original reads "strown" --> with flowers, its brow has won the loftiest plume,
and now we own schools, we must prepare ourselves to
meet the demand of the world, rouse ourselves, and do not
allow our best years to slip past because we have not succeeded
as we thought we would. Why; because the man
who never failed is a myth. If we fail now and then do
not be discouraged. It is indeed a happy<!-- TN: comma deleted --> providence that
given to mankind the bright shining sun of hope to dispel
the gloom of despondency. We have all seen the sunburst
from behind the clouds and light up a storm swept landscape<!-- TN: original reads "landcape" -->.</p>

<p>The trouble is, that many of us when we are under
any affliction, are troubled with certain malicious melancholy,<!-- TN: comma inserted -->
never take notice of the most benighting<!-- TN: original reads "benighing" --> ones.</p>

<p>We must bear in mind that it is only the past and experience
of every successful man. The most successful
men oftener have the most failures. These failures which
to the feeble are mere stumbling blocks, to the strong serve
to remove the scales from their eyes so that they now see
clearer, and go on their way with a firmer tread and more
determined mien, and compel life to yield<!-- TN: original reads "yeild" --> to them its most
enduring trophies.</p>

<p>The world is not coming to an end, nor society going to
destruction, because our petty plans have miscarried. The
present failure should only teach us to be more wary<!-- TN: original reads "weary" --> in
the future and this will gather a rich harvest as the final
outcome of our efforts. The most successful men oftener
has the most failures. So if success were to crown our efforts
now, where would be the great success of our future.</p>




<h3 title="How to succeed—both are needed">HOW TO SUCCEED—BOTH ARE NEEDED.
 <a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
</h3>


<p>Conditions are by no means what they should be unless
there is opportunity for the full development of manners and
politeness.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between manners and politeness.
Manners is one thing and politeness is another. A person possessed
of these qualities, though he had never seen a court,
is truly agreeable; and if without them would continue a
clown, though he had been all his life a gentleman usher. A
traveler of taste at once perceives that the educated men are
polite all the world over, but that ignorant men are polite only
at home. Good manners are well-nigh an essential part of
life’s education, and their importance cannot be too largely
magnified when we consider that they are the outward expression
of an inward virtue. Social courtesies should emanate
from the heart, for remember always that the worth of manners
consists in being the sincere expression of feelings. Like
the dial of a watch, they should indicate that the works within
are good and true. True civility needs no false lights to show
its points. It is the embodiment of truth, the mere opening
out of the inner self.</p>

<p>The truest politeness<!-- TN: original reads "poilteness" --> comes of sincerity. It must be the
outcome of the heart or it will make no lasting impression, for
no amount of polish will dispense with truthfulness. To acquire
that ease and grace of manners which distinguishes and
is possessed by every well-bred person one must think of
others rather than of one’s self, and study to please them even
at one’s own convenience. The golden rule of life is also the
law of politeness, and such politeness implies self-sacrifice,
many struggles and conflicts. It is an art and tact rather
than an instinct and inspiration.</p>

<p>Many a man who now stands ranked as a gentleman because
his smile is ready and his bow exquisite, is in reality unworthy
of an honor, since he cares more for the least incident pertaining
to his own comfort than he does for the greatest occasion
of discomfort to others. A man of politeness and manners does
not hint by words that he deems himself better, wiser or richer<!-- TN: original reads "richeh" -->
than any one about him. He is “never stuck up,” nor looks
down upon others because they have no titles, honors or social
position equal to his own. He never boasts of his achievements
by affecting to underrate what he has done. He prefers to
act rather than to talk, to be busy rather than to seem, above
all things is distinguished by his deep insight and sympathy,
his quick perception of an attention to those little and
<a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>apparently insignificant things that may cause pleasure or pain to
others. In giving his opinions he does not dogmatize. He
listens patiently and respectfully to all other men, and, if compelled
to dissent from their opinions, acknowledges his fallibility
and asserts his own views in such a manner as to command
the respect of all who hear him. Frankness and cordiality
mark all his intercourse with his fellows and, however high
his station, the humblest man feels instantly at ease in his
presence. The success or failure of one’s plans have often
turned upon the address and manner of the man. If we wish
to be successful men and women, we must first be in possession
of both politeness and manners.</p>




<h3 title="Poverty may be a bitter draught, yet it often
is a tonic">POVERTY MAY BE A BITTER DRAUGHT, YET IT OFTEN
IS A TONIC.</h3>


<p>The majority of the men of note in this country are not the
sons of those fathers who could give them all they want, and
much more than they should have, but are those who were
brought up in cottages and cabins cutting their way through
difficulties on every side to their present commanding position.</p>

<p>It is not prosperity so much as advertising, not wealth so
much as poverty, that stimulates the perseverance of strong
and healthy natures, rouses their energies and develops their
character. Indeed, misfortune and poverty have frequently
converted an<!-- TN: original lacks "an" --> indolent votary of society into a useful member of
the community and made him a moving power in the great
workshop of the world, teaching men and developing the powers
which Nature has bestowed on them.</p>

<p>It can’t be too often repeated that it is not the blessings of
life, its sunshine and calms, that make men, but its rugged experiences,
its storms and trials. Thousands of men are bemoaning
present indigence who might have won riches and honor
had they only been compelled by early poverty to develop
their manhood. Poverty does more, perhaps, than anything
else to develop the energetic, self-reliant trait of character,
without which the highest ability makes but sorry work of
life’s battles.</p>

<p>Of all poverty that of the mind is the most deplorable, and
is at the same time without excuse. Every one who wills it
can lay in a rich store of mental wealth. The poor man’s
purse may be empty, but he has as much gold in the sunset,
and as much silver in the moon, as anybody. Wealth of heart
is not dependent upon wealth of purse.</p>

<p>Thus the evils of poverty are much exaggerated, and the
evils, if evils they be, are often all for our own ultimate good.
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Poverty is the great test of civility and touch-stone of friendship.
It is one of the mysteries of our life that genius, the
noblest gift of God to man, is nourished by poverty.</p>




<h3 title="The vice of selfishness displays itself in
many ways.">THE VICE OF SELFISHNESS DISPLAYS ITSELF IN
MANY WAYS.</h3>


<p>The selfish person lives as if the world were made altogether
for him, and not he for the world, to take in everything and
part with nothing. Unselfish and noble acts are the most radiant
epochs in the history of souls, when wrought in earliest
youth, they lie in the memory of age.</p>

<p>Selfishness contracts and narrows our benevolence and
causes us, like serpents, to infold ourselves within ourselves,
and to turn out our stings to all the world besides. As frost
to the bud and blight to the blossom, even such is self-interest
to friendship, for confidence cannot dwell where selfishness
is porter at the gate.</p>

<p>Selfishness is the bone of all life and dwarfs all the better
nature of man. It takes from him that feeling of kindly sympathy
for others’ good, which is one of the most pleasing traits
of manhood, and in itself sets up self as the one whose good
is to be chiefly<!-- TN: original reads "cheifly" --> sought. These withering effects are to be seen
not only in the high road and public places of life, but in
the nooks and bylanes as well. Not alone among conquerors<!-- TN: original reads "conquorers" -->
and kings, but among the humble and obscure in the unsanctified
lust of wealth.</p>

<p>As heat changes the hitherto<!-- TN: original reads "hither to" --> brittle metal into the elastic
yielding, yet deadly Damascus blade, so when the demon of
avarice finds lodgment in the heart of men, it changes all his
better nature.</p>

<p>It may find him delighted to good and relieving the wants
of others; it leaves him one whose whole energy and power
are turned to advancement of self alone.</p>




<h3 title="The greatest misfortune of all is not to be
able to bear misfortune">THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE OF ALL IS NOT TO BE
ABLE TO BEAR MISFORTUNE.</h3>


<p>Heaven in its mercy has placed the fountain of wisdom in
the hidden and concealed depths of the soul, that the children
of misfortune might seek and find in its healthful waters the
antidote and cordial of their cares. Knowledge and sorrow
are blended together, just as ignorance and folly.</p>

<p>Man is like a sword in a shop window. Men that look upon
the perfect blade do not dream of the process by which it was
completed. Man is a sword; daily life is the workshop and
God is the artificer, and the trials and sorrows of life the very
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>things that fashion the man. When borne down by trials they
are sent only for instructions.</p>

<p>In youth we look forward, the future appears calm as we
approach manhood and womanhood life changes its appearance
and becomes tempestuous and rough, as the ocean changes
before the storm. In the changes of life real joy and grief
are never far apart.</p>

<p>Trials come in a thousand different forms and many avenues
are open to their approach. They come with the warm throbbing
of our youthful lives, keep pace with the measured tread
of manhood’s noon, and depart not from the descending footsteps
of decrepitude age. We may not hope to be entirely free
from either disciplinary trials or<!-- TN: original reads "of" --> the fiery darts of the enemy
until we are through with life’s burdens. Men may be so old
that ambition has no chain, but they are never too old to experience
trials. Misfortune gathers around great men as
storms do around great mountains, but, like them, they break
the storms and purify the air. Those who have had misfortune
are like those who know many languages. They have learned
to understand and be understood by all. Time is the rider
that breaks youth. To the young how bright the world looks—how
full of novelty and enjoyment. But as years pass on
they are found to abound in sorrowful scenes as well as those
pleasant scenes of toil, suffering, difficulty and perhaps misfortune
and failure. Happy are they who can pass through
<span class="guesswork" title="reconstructed: missing in original">misfortune wit</span>h<!-- TN: original reads "              h" --> a firm mind and a pure heart, encountering
trials with cheerfulness and standing erect beneath even the
heaviest burdens.</p>

<p>Misfortune is a crown of thorns, but it becomes a wreath
of light on the brow which it has lacerated. Oh, it is a cross
on which the spirit groans. Let us learn to be able to bear our
misfortune, because every Calvary<!-- TN: original reads "cavalry" --> has an Olivet<!-- TN: original reads "Olvit" -->. To every
place of crucifixion there is likewise a place of ascension. So
to be successful in this life we must be able to bear misfortunes.</p>




<h3 title="Adversity the touch stone of character">ADVERSITY THE TOUCH STONE OF CHARACTER.</h3>


<p>At a superficial view it appears that adversity happens to
all alike, without regard to rank or condition. People are continually
rising and falling in all degrees of association. We
often see men of high expectations cut down and left to struggle
with despair and ruin. Much of the most useful work done by
men and women has been amidst afflictions—sometimes as a
relief from it, sometimes as a sense of duty overwhelming
their personal sorrows.</p>

<p><a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>There beats not a heart but that has felt the force of adversity.
There is not an eye but has witnessed many scenes
of sorrow. How can we exercise the grace of contentment if
all things succeed well, or that of forgiveness if we have no
enemies! Sad accidents and a state of adversity are the
school of virtue. It reduces our spirits to soberness and our
counsels to moderation. God, who governs the world in mercy
and wisdom, never would have suffered the virtuous ones to
endure so many afflictions did He not intend that they should
be the seminary of comfort, the nursery of virtue, the exercise
of wisdom and the trial of patience, venturing for a crown and
the gate of glory. Adversity sent by Providence must be submitted
to in a humble spirit, or they will not conduce to lasting
good. As the musician straineth at his strings, and yet breaketh
none of them, but maketh thereby a sweet melody and better
concord. Adversity is the medicine of the mind. If it is not
pleasing it is wholesome. No soul is so obscure that God does
not take thought for its schooling. The sun is the central light
of the solar system; but it has a mission to the ripening corn
and the purpling cluster on the vine, as well as the ponderous
planet. The sunshine that comes fluttering through the morning
mists with healing on its wings, and charging all the birds
to singing, should have also a message from God to sad hearts.
No soul is so grief-laden that it may not be lifted to sources of
heavenly comfort by recognizing the divine love in the recurrence
of earthly blessings. In a great adversity there is no
light either in the mind or in the sun, for when the inward light
is fed with fragrant oil there can be no darkness, though clouds
should cover the sun. But when, like a sacred lamp in the
temple, the inward light is quenched, there is no light outwardly,
though a thousand suns should preside in the heavens.</p>




<h3 title="True dignity of mind">TRUE DIGNITY OF MIND.</h3>


<p>True dignity of mind is always modest in expression. The
grace of an action is gone as soon as we are convinced that
it was done only that persons might applaud the act. But he
who is truly great, and does good because it is his duty, is not
at all anxious that others should witness his acts. His aim is
to do good because it is right.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive of a truly great character and
not think of one with the spirit of kindness. True dignity of
spirit will not dwell with the haughty in manner. True dignity
delights to take up its abode with the generous and those who
seek to relieve the misery of others as they would their own.
As long as human nature is a mass of contradictions this is
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not to be wondered at. But the influence of such men is ever
working, and will sooner or later show itself. Men such as
these are the true life-blood of the community to which they
belong. True dignity of character is within the reach of all.
It is the result of patient endeavors after a life of goodness
and, when acquired, cannot be swept unless by the consent
of its possessor. Wealth may be lost by no fault of its possessor,
but greatness of soul is an abiding quality.</p>

<p>One may fail in his other aims; the many accidents of life
may bring to naught his most patient endeavors after worldly
fame or success; but he who strives for dignity of character
will not fail of reward if he but diligently seek the same by
earnest resolve and patient labor.</p>

<p>Is there not in this a lesson of patience for many who are
almost weary of striving for better things? If success does
not crown their ambitious efforts, will they not be sustained
by the smile of an approving conscience? Strong in this, they
can wait with patience till, in the fullness of time, their reward
cometh.</p>




<h3 title="To be famous we must be ambitious">TO BE FAMOUS WE MUST BE AMBITIOUS.</h3>


<p>Young ladies and gentlemen, an appeal to you.</p>

<p>The desire <!-- TN: original reads "deisre" --> to be thought well of, to desire<!-- TN: original reads "deisre" --> to be great in
goodness, is in itself a noble quality of the mind, and is often
termed ambition. If it is our ambition to gain distinction, we
will rob the weak and flatter the strong, and become the fawning
slave of those who are able to foist us above our betters
and deck us with the titles and honors of the great without any
regard to our own merit of respectability. But if we are
ambitious to do good, without any regard for the fame we may
win or the praise we may command, our course will be honorable
and our acts and deeds most worthy and good. When
we have done with the world the prints of our worthy ambition
we will still remain in the minds of those who come after us
to enjoy and reap the benefits, for which they will revive our
memory and retain our names in the lists of those whose labors
have aided in enlightening the world and exalting the general
interest of mankind.</p>

<p>Much of the advancement of the world can be traced of the
efforts of those who were moved by ambition to become famous.
Ambition is like fire. It is an excellent servant, but a poor
master. As long as it is held strictly to integrity and honor,
and to conform to the requirements of justice, there is but
little danger of a man’s having too much of it.</p>

<p><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Ambition is an excessive quality and, as such, is apt to lead
us to the most extraordinary results. But if our ambition leads
us to excel or seek to excel in that which is good, the currents
it may induce us to support will be of great good. But if it
is stimulated by pride, envy or vanity, we will confine our
support principally to the counter currents of life, and thus
leave behind us misery and destruction.</p>

<p>The happiness promised by ambition dissolves in sorrow just
as we are about to grasp it. It makes the same mistake concerning
wealth. She begins by accumulating power as a means
of happiness, but she finishes by continuing<!-- TN: original reads "continunig" --> to accumulate
it as an end.</p>




<h3 title="Dark and full of disappointments may be our lot">DARK AND FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENTS MAY BE
OUR LOT.</h3>


<p>It is generally known that he who expects much will be
often disappointed; yet disappointment seldom cures us of
expectations. But one of the saddest thoughts that come to
us in life is the thought that in this bright, beautiful and joy-giving
world of ours there are many shadowed lives. There
is but one way in which we can succeed, when we admit that
happiness is but a state of the mind, and that success is the
faithful performance of known duties, then shall we acquire
both. Though we may wander the wide world over and gather
wealth and fame, they will be found impotent to confer happiness,
and life to us will seem full of disappointments; but it is
because we failed to seek for life in that spirit of quiet content
which conducts it. It never happened to any man since the
making of this world nor ever will, to have all things according
to his desires. If you risk nothing, of course you lose nothing.
Let him who is enlisted for the war expect to meet the foe.
It is with life’s troubles as with the risks of the battlefield—there
is always less danger to the party who stands firm than
to the one who gives way. To give way to disappointments is
to invite defeat. To bravely cast about for means to resist them
is to put them to flight, and out of temporary misfortune by
the foundation of a more glorious success, by sending disappointments<!-- TN: original reads "disappintments" -->
to the winds; taking life as it is and with a strong
will, make life as near what it should be as possible.</p>

<p>The most pure lives sometimes are those who are met with
the most disappointments. With some it is the wreck of a
great ambition. Yes, he has built his ship and launched it on
the sea of life loaded with the richest jewels of his strength
and manhood. And behold, it comes back to him beaten and
battered by the fury gale. We may add some rays of sunshine
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to our path if we earnestly try to dispel the clouds of discontent
that may arise in our bosom, and by doing so enjoy fully
the bountiful blessings that God our creator has given to his
humblest creatures.</p>




<h3 title="Memory is the cabinet of the imagination">MEMORY IS THE CABINET OF THE IMAGINATION.</h3>


<p>Memory is the cord binding all the natural gifts and excellences
together, and though it is not wisdom in itself, still
it is the primary fundamental power without which there could
be no other intellectual operations. The memory of good actions
is the starlight of the soul. Yes, it tempers prosperity
by recalling past distress, by bringing up the thoughts of past
joys. It controls youth and delights old age. Without memory
life would be a blank. The mind must be made to think
as to remember and to remember principles and outlines. We
think of faces, and they return to us as plainly as when their
presence gladdened our eyes. When sorrow and trial, care
and temptation surrounded us how often do we gain courage
and renewed strength by thinking of the past. The course of
none has been along so beaten a road that they remember not
fondly some resting places in their journey—some turns in
their path in which lovely prospects broke in upon them. How
much is spoken which deserves no remembrance, and which
does not serve as a simple link in one’s existence not calling
forth one result for others’ need or thrilling one chord with
nobler impulses. The gift of memory is diversified to different
people, some having a taste of history, some for literature and
others delight in politics, and so on through all the different
phases of existence. Memory has been compared to a storehouse.
How much important then that we renew the mind
to healthful actions instead of feeding it on poisons until it
will produce nothing but poisonous thoughts.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
